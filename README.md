# Into the Dungeon
> Dungeon multiplayer game that can be played single- or multi-device. 

## General info
You and other adventurers want to kill all the monsters lurking in a dungeon. But you're not a team: only one player can enter the dungeon, impersonating a previously chosen hero character. 

In every round the players either remove pieces of the hero's equipment or add monsters in the dungeon, making the quest more difficult every time. At some point the players will start stepping back in turns, giving up the task to the last brave or reckless player standing. You succeed in the dungeon if you can kill all monsters before they take all your character's hit points.

This process will be repeated many times, with different hero characters. You will be out of the game if you're killed in the dungeon twice. Otherwise you will win if you survive the dungeon twice or if every other player is out of the game. 

## Built with
This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

ðŸ”Ž **Nx is a set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.**

Nx makes use of:
* [Angular](https://angular.io/) for the front-end.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for the back-end.
* Both Angular and NestJs make use of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* NestJS also makes use of [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

Other libraries and dependencies I use:
* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for theming.
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) framework for writing and running tests.
* [testdouble.js](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js) as test mocking library, along with [testdouble-jest](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble-jest) extension.

## Status
_in progress_

The project is currently a front-end boilerplate with a homepage and two empty lazy-loaded Angular modules. I'm currently working on the service layer of the one-device module.

## Latest updates
**2020-Jun-17:**

* Front-end: Add tests for AppComponent, HomeComponent and main navigation.
* Front-end: Add basic content to HomeComponent.

**2020-Jun-03:**

* Front-end: Split app into one-device and online lazy-loaded modules.

**2020-Jun-01:**

* Start nx boilerplate project.

## Play
There is still no deployed version of this game.

## Inspiration
The game is closely inspired by a board game I play with my housemates. The project serves only a learning purpose, so I claim no originality with regard to the rules and content of the game. However, in order to avoid copyright issues I'll try to include as many changes as possible.

While I have already worked on other Angular and Node.js projects, they still require months of development. I needed something more compact and manageable to showcase my skills in these technologies in my portfolio. I hope it can also be an opportunity to dive into monorepos, Test Driven Development and documentation best practices.
